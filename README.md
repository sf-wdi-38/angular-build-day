Your goal is to quickly design, prototype, and get feedback on an application using React.

### Goals

Make a front-end application that:
* does a very tiny thing very well (keep it simple!)
* is thoughtfully designed
* is pleasant to use
* shows off your skills with React (no jQuery!)

While developing, consider:
* what is the simplist possible solution?
* how will you approach the problem so that you are always making tiny low-cost iterations?
    - Your git commit history should reflect this process
* how will you solicit feedback on your user experience and your technical approach?


### Technical Requirements
* Create a front-end React app with custom HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
* Use client-side routing to create and route to at least two different pages (each with their own components, and possibly their own containers).

> We do not expect you to build a realistic CRUD app with a fully featured backend -- instead, we want you to prototype something of value/interest so that you can quickly get critical feedback on your design and implementation *before you have invested significant resources* in the application.

If appropriate, consider incorporating the following:
* Use data from an external API.
* Use caching to save data from that external API, so your app doesn't make unnecessary requests.
* Incorporate a React component from an external library. Some options:
  * http://davidwells.io/19-open-source-react-component-libraries-to-use-in-your-next-project/
  * http://www.material-ui.com/#/
  * https://devarchy.com/react

### Scope
As usual, less is more. Keep your design simple, and execute on it well. If you have time, feel free to reach for stretch goals.

We feel a realistically scoped project could be one of the following:

* a simple game (flashcards, 20 questions, mancala)
* an api dashboard (some visualization of data, status updates, snacks)
* a display of data from some external backend (either one you already built, or one that exists as an API)
* or a simple tool (a phonebook, notebook, or photo album)

### Deliverables

**A GitHub repository for the project with frequent commits and a README.**

**A working prototype version of your app on the master branch.**

**Optional: A working prototype version of your app deployed on Heroku or Github Pages.**

This is what you'll work on all day; tomorrow morning, we'll do science-fair style presentations of what you've done.
